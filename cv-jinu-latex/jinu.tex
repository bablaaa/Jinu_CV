\begin{resumeblock}{Projects}

\resumeitem{StackIron,\\ Hypervisor Manager}{StackIron is a virtualization platform. StackIron provides a unified interface to man-
age all opensource hypervisors. A pure python implementation for which we developed
our own development framework and billing solution. It comes integrated with third
party billing solutions like WHMCS as well. All basic functionalities like backup, tem-
platization, migration, SAN and local storage management work seamlessly across all
hypervisors.StackIron provides fine grained user control and allows various levels of
user configurations at runtime. StackIron has an optional VLAN and bonding func-
tionality along with Basic Firewall and traffic controlling.}
